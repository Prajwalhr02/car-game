# Car Game - Dr. Driving Inspired

This is a Python-based car game inspired by the popular mobile game Dr. Driving. The goal is to create a simple yet engaging driving game where players can control a car, navigate through obstacles, and achieve objectives.

## Features (Planned)
- Basic car movement (forward, backward, left, right).
- Collision detection with obstacles.
- Score tracking based on distance or objectives.
- Simple graphics using Python libraries like `pygame`.

## Getting Started
1. Install Python (version 3.8 or higher).
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```
3. Follow the development steps below to build the game incrementally.

## Development Steps
1. **Setup the Game Window**: Create a basic game window using `pygame`.
2. **Add Car Movement**: Implement controls for moving the car.
3. **Add Obstacles**: Introduce obstacles for the car to avoid.
4. **Collision Detection**: Detect collisions between the car and obstacles.
5. **Scoring System**: Add a scoring mechanism based on distance or objectives.
6. **Enhancements**: Add sound effects, better graphics, and additional features.

## Roadmap
The development of the game will follow these phases:

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
- Set up the project structure.
- Create a basic game window using `pygame`.
- Add a placeholder for the car and basic movement controls.

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay
- Implement car movement (forward, backward, left, right).
- Introduce obstacles and basic collision detection.
- Add a scoring system based on distance or objectives.

### Phase 3: Visual and Audio Enhancements
- Improve graphics for the car, obstacles, and background.
- Add sound effects for car movement, collisions, and scoring.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Introduce levels or increasing difficulty.
- Add a main menu and pause functionality.
- Implement a leaderboard to track high scores.

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
- Test the game for bugs and performance issues.
- Optimize the code for smoother gameplay.
- Prepare the game for release.

## How to Run
Once the game is developed, you can run it using:
```
python main.py
```
